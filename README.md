R2D2
====

Request/Response Diligent Dispatcher

R2D2 is a Request/Response Service Layer (RRSL) for Java. The project *initiated* from the porting of the [Agatha](http://davybrion.github.io/Agatha/) project by Davy Brion. Any post you can read in his [Request/Response Service Layer Series](http://thatextramile.be/blog/2009/11/requestresponse-service-layer-series/) will help you understand what is a RRSL, how to use one and what are its benefits (I really recommend them).

Note that this project was *initiated* from Agatha but is **not** strictly speaking a software porting of Davy Brion's RRSL from C#/.Net to Java/JEE, although R2D2 can certainly be used as a base for such project. I developed it only because I felt the need for something to simplify exchanges between the presentation tier and the business tier within one of my project.
